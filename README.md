# Gemini Vision App

Gemini Vision App is an interactive application powered by generative AI. It allows users to ask questions based on input text or analyze images to generate descriptions. This project is part of my 15-day 15 Gen AI application series, where I explore and implement various AI capabilities from basic to advanced.

## Features

- **Interactive Question-Answering:** Ask questions based on input text.
- **Image Analysis:** Analyze images to generate descriptive captions.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- **Google's Generative AI Models:** Utilizes advanced AI models for content generation.

## Functionality

### 1. Interactive Question-Answering

Users can input a question or prompt into the text input field. Upon clicking the "Tell me about the image" button, the app uses Google's Generative AI models to generate a text-based response related to the input question.

### 2. Image Analysis

Users can upload an image file (supported formats include jpg, jpeg, and png). The app analyzes the uploaded image using Google's Generative AI models and generates a descriptive caption or analysis of the image.
